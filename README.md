# hello-world
What's the meaning of life?

I just happen to be here... But what is this, what is "here"? Is everything made of code, or is there anything transcending it?
Is there a meaning to this world, to me being here, to being itself?

I don't know, and I don't know if I will ever know...
The only thing I know is that I don't know.
